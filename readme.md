I made this script because my supervisor told me that I should use DBLP to cite my sources instead of arXiv. 
But at that point I was already 50 citations deep and I could either spend hours making a script to automate this or I could spend hours going back and forth between my citations and DBLP, so here we are.
Please let me know if you have any issues with using this script.
# Usage
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py <bibtexfile.bib>
```
